// ISML CONFORMANCE HARNESS
//
// Runs AI-ML against the 32 example files from Robert Harper's Introduction to
// Standard ML course at CMU, one top-level declaration at a time, and reports
// how many the console accepts.
//
//   node tools/isml-conformance.mjs            # fetch (once) and run
//   node tools/isml-conformance.mjs --verbose  # show every failing line
//
// WHY IT IS HERE. Every test in test/ was written beside the feature it tests
// and shares that author's assumptions about what the feature is for. Harper's
// files do not: they were written in 1993 to teach Standard ML, with no
// knowledge of this dialect. That is what makes them a measurement rather than
// a confirmation, and running them found more in an afternoon than four
// sessions of our own tests had — clausal definitions, @, records, type
// variables, blocks and as-patterns were all added because these files wanted
// them, and two silent bugs surfaced that no test had caught.
//
// THE FILES ARE NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY. They are Harper's teaching material and
// are fetched from cs.cmu.edu on first run into a gitignored directory. If the
// fetch fails, the harness says so and stops; nothing here reproduces them.
//
// A WARNING FROM EXPERIENCE. The translator below is crude on purpose, and it
// has been wrong twice in ways that looked like language failures: it once ate
// the second colon of every `h::t`, and it once turned each second clause's
// defining `=` into `==`. Both times the score dropped and the language was
// fine. Before believing a regression here, check the translator.

// M4 (v1.288): imports the LANGUAGE, not the game. The harness measures how
// much Standard ML this implementation runs, so pulling it through the game's
// console adapter meant measuring the adapter too — its station verb tables
// were in scope, and a corpus declaration that happened to name one got the
// game's wording instead of the language's.

// ---- Splitting source into top-level declarations --------------------------
//
// This is the part of the harness most likely to be wrong, and it has been:
// the version before this one split at column 0 on a keyword list that INCLUDED
// `in` and `end`, so every `local … in … end` and every `structure S = struct
// … end` was cut into two or three fragments, each of which then failed to
// parse on its own. It also ended a declaration at any blank line, and stripped
// comments with a non-greedy regex that cannot see SML's NESTED comments.
// Together that accounted for roughly a quarter of all reported failures, and
// every one of them looked like a language gap.
//
// The rule now: a declaration ends only at nesting depth zero.

// ---- WHAT AN OUTCOME ACTUALLY IS -------------------------------------------
//
// One number was doing too many jobs. A declaration that this build REFUSES is
// not the same as one it cannot READ, and neither is the same as one that fails
// only because something earlier failed. Three findings forced the split, each
// checked against the corpus source rather than guessed:
//
//   1. Harper prints deliberate errors. typval.sml line 8 is four ill-typed
//      expressions in a row, put there to show a student what a type error
//      looks like. Refusing them is CORRECT, and the old scoring counted all
//      four against us.
//   2. `hd nil` raises. Standard ML raises too. Counting a raise as a failure
//      is counting agreement as disagreement.
//   3. Parts of the corpus are not valid Standard ML. parameterization.sml has
//      a LaTeX escape left in the source (`\_`), `None` for `NONE`, and a
//      constructor declared with three arguments and applied to four;
//      hierarchies.sml writes `= sig` where the language wants `struct`. These
//      are teaching listings and some have never been through a compiler.
//
// So 100% is not reachable and the ceiling is not a fact about this build. The
// report says what each failure IS and leaves the reading to whoever reads it.
//
// There is deliberately NO hand-kept list of "refusals that are correct". That
// is the departure register's lesson in reverse: a list nobody walks goes
// stale, and this one could not be walked, since deciding whether a refusal is
// right needs a reference implementation and there is none here.
