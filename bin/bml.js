// This file imports src/ and nothing else: no game, no stations, no verbs.
// It builds one interpreter through the same `createInterpreter` NostOS uses,
// and differs from the game only in what it passes — strict rather than
// advisory, and no host hooks at all. The game is advisory everywhere because a
// machine in a ruin should say what it worked out and let the operator decide.

// WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO, because a tool that quietly contacts a server
// is the opposite of the thing this repository argues for.
//
// It fetches one file, package.json, from the public repository, and compares
// its version to this one. It sends no identity, no telemetry and no arguments;
// what a web server can infer is that some IP asked for a public file, which is
// true of reading the README.
//
// It runs ONLY in an interactive session: not for `bml file.ml`, not in a
// pipe, not in CI, not under a test. It caches for a day, times out after a
// second and a half, and fails silently, so it can never delay or break a
// session. `BML_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` turns it off entirely.
const VERSION_URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/critical-code-studies/BML/main/package.json';
// The cache path is overridable, and the tests override it. They used to write
// the REAL one: a test planted a cache claiming 99.0.0 was out, to prove a
// piped session stays quiet, and every later interactive session read it and
// announced an update that did not exist. Test fixtures must not be able to
// reach into the thing they are testing.
// THE STEP BUDGET AT A PROMPT. Every run counts steps so a program that never
// comes back faults instead of hanging. The default is the GAME's, 200,000,
// picked so a machine's program cannot stall a render loop — and a command line
// has no render loop, so a REPL inherited a constraint it does not have. It
// stopped `sum (20000, 0)` in the same release that gave the language proper
// tail calls.
//
// 50 million: a runaway faults in about a second, and `sum (1000000, 0)` runs.
