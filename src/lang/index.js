// BML — a little Standard ML. The public surface.
//
// This is the file a host imports. Everything reachable from here is the
// language; nothing here knows about NostOS. When src/lang/ is split out to
// its own repository (docs/aiml-standalone-plan.md §5) this becomes that
// repository's entry point unchanged.
//
// The in-fiction name inside NostOS stays AI-ML, and the adapter keeps its own
// version banner and its own wording for `ml -ver`. The names below are the
// language's own.

// 0.1.0, and starting there is the point. The language carries a longer
// history than that and `git log` has it, but a version number on a package
// means one specific thing: how stable the API is. `createInterpreter` is days
// old and its contract has already changed three times (the return dropped
// `value`, then gained `printing`, then `primitives`), so 2.7 would have
// claimed two major versions of a settled interface that has never existed.
// The language's own lineage belongs in the history and the README, not here.
