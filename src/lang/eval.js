// WHY THE STATE IS MODULE-LEVEL, and why it moved here rather than being
// re-plumbed. FUEL and STEPS are module-level for the same reason the print
// buffer is: a closure captures the ctx of the line that DEFINED it, so hanging
// a counter off ctx meant a function called on a later line counted against the
// wrong budget, and hanging the buffer off ctx silently swallowed the output of
// any function called on a later line. Both were real bugs. Threading them as
// parameters would mean touching every one of evalNode's recursive calls, which
// is a larger change than this stage is allowed to make.

// (a human is waiting, and a wrong line should still finish); for a machine's
// own program it is small and strict, because a unit whose program overruns is
// not an error message — it is a FAULT in that machine, and it should read that

// program could go was whatever the host stack had left. `count 5000` faulted at
// about 1950, and the same program passed alone and failed inside a full test
// run, which made one test a barometer for unrelated changes.
//
// The body is a loop. In every TAIL position — where the value of the
// sub-expression IS the value of this one — the case reassigns `node` (and
// `env`, `ctx`, `builtins` where they change) and `continue`s, rather than
// calling back into evalNode and waiting. The step counter is inside the loop,
// so a tail loop still counts and the budget still bounds a program that never
// comes back.
//
// This does NOT make non-tail recursion unbounded. `fact n = n * fact (n-1)` has
// work to do after the call returns, so its frames are genuinely needed and it
// stays where it was. See stage 2 in the plan for what removing that would cost.
