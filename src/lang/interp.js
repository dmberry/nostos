// src/game/ai_ml.js. See docs/aiml-standalone-plan.md §4.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. Before it, the entry point mixed two jobs: reading and
// running a line of ML, and being NostOS's console (intercepting `help`, picking
// a verb table by station, wording an error as "isn't a command on this
// terminal"). The first job is the language. The second belongs to whoever is
// hosting it. `createInterpreter` takes the second as OPTIONS, so the game
// passes its four station tables and its wording, and the command-line REPL
// passes almost nothing.
//
// THE RULE THE HOOKS FOLLOW, and it is the one M2 arrived at: the language calls
// host policy, it never reads host tables. Every hook below is a question the
// language asks and the host answers. None of them lets the host reach in.

//
// The closures. A closure holds the environment it captured, which holds the
// closure, so a session with a function in it CANNOT be stringified at all. In
// NostOS that was a live bug and a quiet one: `player.laptop` goes into the
// save blob, so defining a function at the NostBook made JSON.stringify throw,
// the throw was swallowed by the `catch { }` around localStorage, and the game
// stopped saving without saying so. A closure could never have been restored
// from JSON in any case, so the honest thing is to leave it out.

  // closures made earlier keep reading the frame they captured, and later
