// This list fires BEFORE the parser's own message, because the parser's message
// for a signature block names the colon it choked on, which helps nobody. That
// also makes it dangerous: a rule left here after the feature lands hides the
// real error. A test walks NOT_FITTED_SAMPLES and asserts each is still
// genuinely refused, which is the only thing that has ever kept it honest.

  // A test walks this list and asserts every pattern here still FAILS to parse.
  // That is the only thing that has stopped it going stale: it went on refusing
  // modules, exceptions, chars, local and refs after each of them shipped, six
  // times, and every time it fired before the parser and hid the real error.
  // `infix`/`infixr`/`nonfix`/`op` were here until v1.277 added them, and
  // String/List/Int/Option were here until v1.257 added them. Both pruned by
  // the test below, which is the only thing that has ever kept this honest.
  // ONLY the structures that are genuinely absent. Word, Array, Vector, IO,
  // TextIO, Math, Substring and General were on this line long after they
  // landed, so a bad MEMBER of a present structure — `Math.map` — was reported
  // as a missing library. Exactly what the note above warns about, and it took
  // a user typing `date` to notice.

// are two names and a reader who typed the first meant the second.
// A word from another language maps either to the ML WORD for it (one token,
// printed as "Standard ML writes X") or to a whole sentence, when the honest
// answer is that ML does not have the idea at all.
